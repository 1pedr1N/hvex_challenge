### My Experience

This is a nice challenge to do, I did the website w/ figma design, sometimes I had some problems with the design, but I did it. I used React, Typescript, Styled Components, and I used the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy the website. I dont did the responsive because dont have on figma design, but I did the website in 2 days, I think I did a good job, I hope you like it.
